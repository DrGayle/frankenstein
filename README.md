# Frankenstein
48-day reading chunks for Frankenstein by Mary Shelley

This is a class resource for a 48-day study of *Frankenstein* by Mary Shelley.  
It includes anchor links for navigation but also links out to other materials, including a Google Form that can be edited each day for individual annotation of the text outside of the classroom.
For credit, the reader may get ahead or just stay with the 48-day day-by-day schedule. There will be no homework credit for any late annotation. The homework is a 10% credit; while collaborative classwork in the classroom with classmates is the other 90% credit.
